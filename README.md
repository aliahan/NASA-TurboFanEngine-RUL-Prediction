# NASA Turbofan Jet Engine Remaining Useful Life Prediction

This repository hosts the source code and findings of our Data Mining course project, conducted by Ali Ahangarpour and Aghil Zeinalzadeh, at the University of Victoria, submitted on April 8, 2024. Our project aims to address the critical challenge of predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbo-machinery, focusing on turbofan jet engines, leveraging NASA's C-MAPSS dataset. This prediction is paramount in the aviation industry for enhancing predictive maintenance strategies, ensuring operational reliability, and achieving cost efficiency.

We developed a comprehensive machine-learning framework that integrates multi-sensor time-series data to predict the RUL with high precision. Our study evaluates various data-driven techniques, emphasizing advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting Machine and Logistic Regression among others, for their robustness and predictive power. Our findings reveal the Gradient Boosting Machine's potential in RUL modeling with notable accuracy (MSE: 0.018, R^2 score: 0.83) and the effectiveness of Logistic Regression in classifying engines into operational states ('Danger', 'Not Danger Yet', and 'Safe') with high recall for critical cases.
